                HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and
                web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.

                Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext.
                Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext.
                HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.

                Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting
                conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn
                text into images, tables, links, etc.
                Web Page: A web page is a is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A
                web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the
                help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.

            <div id="CONTENT-CSS">
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling
                of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
                MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
                JavaScript.[2]

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more
                flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages
                to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
                repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load
                speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

            <div id="CONTENT-JS">
                JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of
                the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
                behavior.[10]

                Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also
                utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is
                Node.js.

                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It
                is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
                data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
