            <b>The Science of Asanas
            The science of asanas is known as hatha yoga. “Ha” means sun, “ta” means moon. The first process of yoga is
            to bring balance between the masculine and feminine in you. Otherwise there will be no scaling of
            consciousness. This is why Shiva is known as Ardhanarishvara one half of him is a woman, another half of
            him is a man. He is a man and the very embodiment of manhood.</b>
